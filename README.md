# Captcha Solver Frontend This project provides a simple, responsive single-file HTML application designed to act as a frontend for human-assisted captcha solving. It displays a captcha image and allows users to input the text they interpret from the image. ## Features - **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices. - **Dynamic Image Loading**: Loads captcha images from a URL specified in the query parameters (e.g., `?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`). - **Default Image Fallback**: If no URL is provided, it defaults to displaying `sample.png` from the local directory. - **User Input Interface**: Provides a clear input field for users to type the captcha text. - **Basic Verification Feedback**: Offers immediate feedback on the entered text (though actual captcha verification would typically occur on a backend server). For the `sample.png`, it specifically checks for "ADCRB". ## How to Use 1. **Open `index.html` in your browser.** 2. **To display a custom captcha image**: Append `?url=` followed by the URL of your captcha image to the `index.html` URL in your browser. * Example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/api/get-captcha` 3. **To use the default image**: Simply open `index.html`. It will display `sample.png`. 4. **Enter the text** you see in the image into the input field. 5. **Click "Verify Captcha"** or press `Enter`. The application will provide feedback based on your input. ## Local Setup To run this application locally, simply save `index.html`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `sample.png` in the same directory. Then, open `index.html` with your web browser. ## Technologies Used - **HTML5**: Structure of the web page. - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsiveness. - **JavaScript**: For dynamic image loading and user interaction. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
